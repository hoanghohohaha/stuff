1,Morty,"I got to tell you, Rick. It’s pretty great to be in this spaceship, just the two of us, you know? Just cruising around, Rick and Morty style."

12,Arthricia,Your vehicle... is it from the gods?
13,Morty,No.
14,Rick,Yes.
15,Jerry,"Whatcha doing? Watching some TV, playing on your phone?"
16,Summer,Is that a real question?
17,Summer,"My choice is to say nothing, be sarcastic, or bark ""yes"" like a trained animal."
18,Summer,It’s not a conversation. You’re holding me verbally hostage.
19,Jerry,"Okay, ass-face. I’ll go in the kitchen."
20,Summer,"Hey, dad."

35,Rick,"She got me right in the goddamn liver, Morty."
36,Rick,Purge 'em.
37,Morty,Me?
38,Rick,"No, me. Should I rub my liver hole on them? Pick up a stick or something and kill them."
39,Jerry,Want some crackers?
40,Summer,"No, thank you."
41,Jerry,Are you ready to be nice to me?
42,Summer,In exchange for crackers?
43,Jerry,What happened to you?
44,Summer,"Dad, get a job."
45,Summer,Hello?
46,Rick,"Hey, Summer, it’s grandpa."
47,Rick,Morty and I are on a planet that’s purging.
48,Summer,"Dad, who the fuck is Taddy Mason?"
49,Summer,"Holy shit, Dad! Shut the fuck up!"
50,Jerry,Okay. I guess I’m just this entire family’s toilet paper.
51,Summer,"Yes, yes."
52,Rick,"Morty, I don't want to be the ""a little help"" guy, but a little help?"
53,Rick,"Morty, if we’re gonna survive tonight, you’re gonna need to harness your repressed rage."
54,Morty,I don’t have any!
55,Rick,Spoken like a person with repressed rage.
56,Summer,"Oh, he might have said to take it outside."
57,Rick,"Come on, Summer."
58,"""Blane","Maybe I don’t need a new friend."""
59,Jacey,Maybe you’re the only friend I need.
60,Blane,"Need, or want?"
61,Jacey,I’ve never been much for wanting.
62,"""Blane","Spoken like someone with needs."""
63,Morty,"Rick, I didn’t do anything."
64,Rick,"Whoa, Morty. You just purged."
65,Summer,"Dad, what’s going on? What’s the deal here?"
66,Jerry,I just wanted to spend some time with my daughter.
67,Jerry,"Remember when we used to go to the playground, and I’d push you on the swings?"
68,Summer,"Oh, you could push me higher than all the other kids."
69,Rick,Morty. Time to [Belches] purge.
70,Rick,"Geez. Wow, Morty. Now you’re getting into it. Never expected that out of you."
71,Morty,Suck my dick.
72,Morty,Eat this!
73,Rick,"I, uh [Belches] I think, uh [Belches] I think those people were just hiding."
74,Morty,I don’t give a shit!
75,Rick,"Okay, Morty, now you’re just shooting corpses."
76,Morty,How do you like this?
77,Arthricia,I was going to use your ship to destroy the rich assholes that run our society and save my people from the horrors of this yearly festival.
78,Morty,"Fuck that, Rick! We got to kill her! Kill her! Kill her!"
79,Rick,"Whoa! Geez, Morty, purge it down a little."
80,Rick,Morty [Belches] you’re acting like a [Belches] freaking lunatic.
81,Morty,"Screw you, Rick! I'll purge you, too, you old, rickety piece of crap! This has been a long time coming! I""m gonna rip your fucking guts out and smear them all over your face! I ain’t taking no sh... aah!"
82,Arthricia,"Happy festival, cocksuckers! Suck my cock! Chew my balls!"
83,Morty,"Oh, man. What... what happened?"
84,Morty,"Hey, hey, Arthricia, um, maybe I could... uh, I have a boyfriend."
85,Man,And there’s the approach.
86,Beth,"Jerry, what is ""Taddi Mason LLC,"" and why is our phone bill $700?"
