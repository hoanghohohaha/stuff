1,Morty,Cool.
2,Rick,"*points out the window* See that planet right there? Don’t fly too close to that planet. Someone’ll come out and try to wash your windshield. (Rick’s phone rings.) Hold on. *picks up* Yup. Yeah, I have it. Where do you wanna meet? Alright, cool. *hangs up* Alright Morty, lesson’s over. We got some business to attend to a few lightminutes south of here."
3,Jerry,"Oh, you still use ‘south’ in space?"
4,Rick,"*startled* WHOA! Jesus, Jerry, what the hell are you doing here?!"
5,Jerry,What
6,Rick,"I guess I remember that. *rubs forehead* Wow. And you’ve just been back there this whole time? Amazing. Well we don’t have time to take him to Earth, Morty. Head for 3124-917."
7,Jerry,*chuckles* Cool! Looks like I’m comin’ along for an adventure!
8,Rick,Yep.
9,Morty,This is where we’re going?
10,Rick,"Nope. (An asteroid-like mass materializes before them.) This is. You can park in a handicapped spot, Morty. Anything with less than eight limbs is considered"
11,Jerry-Sitter,Well look at this fella. *pinches Jerry’s cheek* Aren’t you handsome?
12,Jerry,Thank you! I’m Jerry. *extends hand*
13,Jerry-Sitter,"*as if speaking to a child* Oh, I know you are. Did you come here in a spaceship?"
14,Jerry,"I’m travelling with my son and father-in-law. Uh, wait, are they coming?"
15,Jerry-Sitter,"Oh, they’ll be back soon."
16,Jerry,What?
17,Pajama Jerry,I don’t know how this works!
18,Underpants Jerry,Help me!
19,Jerry,What the hell?
20,Pajama Jerry,"I know, right?"
21,Tuxedo Jerry,"*enters room* Oh, what the hell?"
22,Jerry,"I know, right?"
23,Morty,*looking at a pamphlet* Jerryboree? You created a daycare for my dad?
24,Rick,"You kidding? I wish I had this idea. Well… I did have this idea, but I wish I was the version of me that owned it. That guy’s rich."
25,Receptionist,Don’t forget to check the reason for your drop-off.
26,Rick,"*checks off “Stowaway” and “Annoying me”* Trust me Morty, I’ve heard stories from other Ricks. Jerrys don’t tend to last five minutes off of Earth. This is a totally unregistered cross-temporal asteroid. Here they can romp and play with other Jerrys. It couldn’t be safer."
27,Rick,"Hey Morty, hang onto this. That number’s your dad. If you lose it, we’re not gonna be able to get him back."
28,Rick,"Okay, wait here."
29,Morty,I wanna come with.
30,Rick,"Don’t come with. It’s boring, it’s *burps* business stuff."
31,Morty,"What kinda business do you do in a garage? You know, this seems a little shady."
32,Rick,"Right, like nothing shady ever happened in a fully furnished office? You ever hear about Wall Street Morty? Y-You know what those guys do in th—in their fancy board rooms? They take their balls, and they dip ‘em in cocaine, and they wipe ‘em all over each other. You know, Grandpa goes around, and he does his business in public because Grandpa isn’t shady."
33,Rick,"Ah, crap. *rolls down window* Hey, what’s up?"
34,Krombopulos Michael,"Hey, Rick! Haha! Here you go, three thousand Flurbos! D’you have the weapon?"
35,Rick,"Can… Can we please…? This is my grandson, Morty."
36,Krombopulos Michael,Well hi Morty! I’m Krombopulos Michael! I’m an assassin. I buy guns from your grandpa.
37,Rick,"Ugh. *passes Krombopulos Michael a case containing the antimatter gun* Here, now go away."
38,Krombopulos Michael,"*examines weapon* Ooh, yeah, this looks deadly. So this shoots"
39,Rick,Y-Y-Y-You’re gonna give him your card?!
40,Krombopulos Michael,"I have no code of ethics, I will kill anyone, anywhere! Children, animals, old people, doesn’t matter. I just love killin’!"
41,Morty,…You sell weapons to killers for money?
42,Rick,"Ugh… You’ve got what the intergalactic call a very planetary mindset, Morty. It’s more complicated out here! These are Flurbos. Do you understand what two humans can accomplish with three thousand of these?"
43,Morty,"Uh, what?"
44,Rick,An entire afternoon at Blips and Chiiiitz!
45,Rick,"Aw, this place is the best. It’s got beer, games, prizes, and you can never tell what time it is."
46,Morty,You sold a gun to a murderer so you could play video games?
47,Rick,"Yeah, sure, if you spend all day shuffling words around you can make anything sound bad, Morty. *puts a helmet on Morty’s head* Here, check this out."
48,Roy,Ah!
49,Roy’s mother,"Roy, what’s wrong?"
50,Roy,I…had a nightmare. I was with an old man… He put a helmet on me.
51,Roy’s mother,"It’s just a fever. Get some sleep, I don’t want you missing school on Monday. *walks out of the room and switches off the lights*"
52,Teacher,I want you kids to look around you today and think about your future. (Roy looks outside and sees kids playing with a football. He smiles.) Now is the time in your life when anything is possible.
53,Announcer,"Spiraling perfectly, it’s gonna be caught by Roy Parsons! Roy Parsons is at the 20! (Roy makes eye contact with a girl in the stands.) Now he’s at the 10! Nothing can stop Roy the Rocket! Touchdown!"
54,Roy’s wife,I just think it’s time to get realistic. Have you talked to my father about the carpet store? Roy?
55,Doctor,"Had we caught it sooner… Well, hindsight is 20-20, Roy. What’s important is that we move quickly."
56,Roy,I’m not…ready to die…
57,Roy’s wife,*takes his hand* You’re not going to.
58,Customer,"Hey, thanks for the carpet, Roy."
59,Voice,"*shouting from off screen* Hey Roy, you pull those Persian off-white shags for the clearance sale?"
60,Roy,Whoa. Sh-shit! Shit!
61,Morty,Whoa! What the hell?! Wha—Where am I?! What the hell?!
62,Rick,"Fifty-five years. Not bad, Morty. You kinda wasted your thirties though with"
63,Morty,*looks
64,Rick,"Morty. You were just playing a game. It’s called Roy. Snap out of it, come on. *hands him his tickets*"
65,Morty,"I’m Morty… You’re Rick… Hey, you sold a gun to a guy that kills people!"
66,Rick,Lookit
67,Morty,"Don’t dodge the issue, Rick! Selling a gun to a hitman is the same as pulling the trigger!"
68,Rick,"It’s also the same as doing nothing. If Krombopulos Michael wants someone dead, there’s not a lot anybody can do to stop him. That’s why he does it for a living? Now if you’ll excuse me, it’s time to thrash your Roy score. *puts on the helmet*"
69,Morty,"You could stop this killing from happening, Rick! You know, y-you did a bad thing selling that gun, but you could undo it if you wanted!"
70,Rick,"Uh-huh, yeah, that’s the difference between you and me, Morty. I never go back to the carpet store."
71,Alien,"*passing by, sees Rick playing Roy* Holy shit! This guy’s taking Roy off the grid! (Other alien patrons gasp and congregate around Rick.) This guy doesn’t have a social security number for Roy!"
72,Jerry,"Hi, I’m sorry, I think there was a misunderstanding. I’m an adult and would like to go home, please."
73,Jerry-Sitter,Well of course! Right through that tube. *points to a tube in the wall*
74,Jerry,*muttering to self* Unbelievable. *approaches the tube and starts climbing in*
75,Jerry-Sitter,You’re doing great!
76,Jerry,"*indignantly* I know how to crawl in a tube. *to himself, while crawling* Ugh… Come on… This is harder than it looks… (Suddenly the tube transitions into a slide.) Whoooooaaaa!"
77,Pink-shirt Jerry,Marco? (Jerrys laugh.) Marco?
78,Other Jerry,Come find me.
79,Pink-shirt Jerry,Marco? (Jerrys laugh again.)
80,Jerry,You guys are enjoying this? Don’t you feel a little… patronized?
81,Pink-shirt Jerry,How so?
82,Daycare Beth,Jerry!
83,Other Jerry,Beeeth.
84,Jerry,"Oh, come on, this is ridiculous!"
85,Daycare Beth,"I love you, Jerry!"
86,Jerry,Aw… Beth…
87,Daycare Beth,Who wants to come watch Midnight Run with director’s commentary on?
88,Jerrys,Oh! Yes! Definitely!
89,Daycare Beth,First one there gets to adjust the picture settings!
90,Jerry,The factory tint setting is always too high! *climbs out of the ballpit and hurries after “Beth” with the other Jerrys*
91,Other Jerry,Out of my way!
92,Another Jerry,The factory tint setting is always too high!
93,Michael,"Oh boy, here I go killin’ again!"
94,Ship,You have
95,Morty,"*dazed* All out of off-white Persians… *gets out of the ship and realizes he killed Krombopulos Michael* Oh man, wha-wh-wh-what have I done?! *picks up KM’s arm and the antimatter gun*"
96,Gromflomite,(pointing a gun at Morty) Drop the gun!
97,Morty,You don’t understand! This guy was gonna kill someone!
98,Gromflomite,I guess that makes two of us. *fires up his weapon*
99,Rick,"What are you doing Morty?! This is a Galactic Federation outpost! Look, I don’t have time to tell you my entire backstory, but Grandpa and government don’t get along!"
100,Fart,You saved my life!
101,Rick,What?
102,Morty,Huh?! Are you Krombopulos Michael’s target? W-Wwwwhat’s your name?
103,Fart,"My kind has no use for names. I communicate through what you call “Jessica’s feet.” No, “telepathy.”"
104,Rick,"Oh, good job, Morty. Y-Y-Y-You killed my best customer but you saved a mind-reading fart!"
105,Fart,"I like this name, ‘Fart.’ Morty, would you kindly release me by pulling that lever to the left of my cell? I am in great pain."
106,Rick,"Morty, don’t do it. (Morty walks toward the lever.) Morty… (Morty glances at Rick before pulling the lever. Alarms start to sound as Fart escapes his cell.) Morty, you idiot!"
107,Morty,"Oh crap, let’s get you outta here!"
108,Rick,"We can’t get him outta here. He’s gaseous. He’s not gonna make it through a portal, Morty."
109,Morty,"*stomps past Rick* Well then I guess we’re all getting in the car! Right, uh…"
110,Fart,Fart.
111,Morty,No! Jus-j-j-just get in the car!
112,Rick,"Morty, come on, I-I wanna go back to Blips and Chitz. I don’t wanna deal with this!"
113,Morty,"Y-You’ve been clear on the fact that you don’t wanna help, so just go away!"
114,Fart,More are coming.
115,Rick,Screw this. I’m out.
116,Morty,"Oooh…! Come on, come on!"
117,Gromflomite,Get out of the vehicle made of garbage or we will open fire!
118,Morty,*still trying to start the car* Oh no no no!
119,Gromflomite,Open fire!
120,Rick,Stupid-ass fart-saving carpet-store motherfucker! *shoves Morty out of the driver’s seat and takes the wheel* Move!
121,Rick,"Wait, did you fuck with my seat settings?"
122,Fart,More are coming.
123,Morty,Rick!
124,Rick,"Yeah, yeah. (He crashes the car into the Gromflomites before flying away from the outpost.)"
125,Gearhead,Your geldon convertor is pretty dinged up.
126,Rick,"That’s ‘cause my grandson drives like a male Obavradian. Yeah, I said it. Some stereotypes are based in fact."
127,Gearhead,"Actually, it’s because of years of neglect. You really need to respect your gears, Rick. To you, they’re just wheels with teeth, but in my culture, wars have been fought, entire—"
128,Rick,"*interrupts him* So I’ve heard. Just fix it. *to Morty* I don’t think the Gromflomites can track us now, but it looks like we’re gonna be here for awhile. *lowers voice* Or, ya know, if you still have that gun K. Michael dropped, we can finish the job and go home."
129,Fart,"You do understand I’m telepathic, right?"
130,Rick,I’m being polite.
131,Morty,"Rick, we’re taking him back where he belongs!"
132,Rick,"Yeah, where’s that? Are you going on a quest to find he who smelt it?"
133,Fart,"I came here accidentally through a wormhole located in what you call “get out of my head, Fart, I know you’re in here, la la la la—” No, in what you call the Promethean Nebula."
134,Rick,"Oh great, just a hop, skip, and an 800 lightyear jump!"
135,Morty,"You know, you can leave any time you want, Rick."
136,Rick,"*walks away, muttering* Whatever you wanna do you little punk-ass little bitch…"
137,Fart,"Thank you, Morty. You are not like other carbon-based life forms. You put the value of all life above your own."
138,Morty,That’s how things should be. It’s how they could be.
139,Fart,I could not agree more.
140,Fart,"(singing over a montage formed from Morty’s imagination) The world can be one together / Cosmos without hatred / Stars like diamonds in your eyes. / The ground can be space (space, space, space, space) / With feet marching toward a peaceful sky. / All the moonmen want things their way / But we make sure they see the sun. / Goodbye, moonmen / You say goodbye, moonmen. / Goodby—"
141,Rick,*holding a golf club* Shut the fuck up about moonmen! This isn’t a musical number. This
142,Random Jerry,"*opens email and laughs* Duck, duck, birdie? (All Jerrys open emails and laugh.) Very funny!"
143,Jerry,Here comes another funny…
144,Other Jerry,"Hahaha! Oh, this place is great."
145,Jerry,I almost wish I could stay longer than one day.
146,Other Jerry,*suddenly serious* You just might.
147,Jerry,W-What do you mean?
148,Other Jerry,"These are the Jerrys whose Ricks and Mortys never came back. (Forgotten Jerrys stand, sit, and lie around the room, generally looking despondent.) …They live here now."
149,Jerry,Uuuum…
150,Gear Anchor,No gear turnings as of yet in the curious case of these unidentified humanoid fugitives (An image of Rick and Morty in the car as Rick was adjusting the seat settings appears onscreen.) reportedly at large somewhere within the Gear System.
151,Rick,Son of a… *approaches Fart* Why were the Gromflomites holding you prisoner? What the fuck is so valuable about you?
152,Fart,"I am no more valuable than life itself. However, I am able to alter the composition of atoms, like this. (An electric fuzz seems to go through the gaseous cloud and a lump of gold materializes, dropping to the ground beneath him.) That was oxygen. I added seventy-one protons to it."
153,Rick,"*picks up the gold* Ah, terrific. The fart that pooped gold. No wonder every cop in the system is lookin’ for us! *pockets gold* Any species that gets a hold of this thing is gonna use it to take over the galaxy. Do you know how inconvenient that’s gonna be to my work?"
154,Rick,Somebody dropped the dime on us. Gearhead… *turns around*
155,Gearhead,"*pointing a gun at Rick* I’m sorry, Rick. The reward on your head is too high. And like you always say, you gotta look out for Number One."
156,Rick,"Number One is me, asshole! You’re supposed to be my friend!"
157,Gearhead,Friend? Do you even know my real name? It’s Revolio Clockberg Junior. I belong to an entire species of gear people. Calling me ‘Gearhead’ is like calling a Chinese person ‘Asia-face.’
158,Gearhead,"No, not twigs!"
159,Rick,"Two things I wanna make clear to everybody in this room. Never betray me, and it’s time to go."
160,Gear Policeman #1,Nobody move!
161,Gear Policeman #2,Oh my god.
162,Gear Policeman #1,Are those…?
163,Rick,"Hey Morty, remember when you said selling a gun was as bad as pulling the trigger? How do you feel about all these people getting killed because of your choices?"
164,Morty,I did
165,Rick,Tell
166,Morty,You did
167,Rick,Wrong! I’d
