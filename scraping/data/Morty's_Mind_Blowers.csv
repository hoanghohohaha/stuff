1,Rick,"Morty, hurry!"
2,Goth Creature,Return the Truth Tortoise! [chases after them]
3,Rick,"Morty, whatever you do, don't drop the Truth Tortoise! Also, really important--whatever you do, don't look into its eyes!"
4,Morty,"I-I did look at it, Rick! I've been looking at it!"
5,Rick,"Now you're gonna know everything, Morty! [the Goth Creature almost catches up after them] Good job! Way to go! You fucked everything up!"
6,Morty,It's in my head! Oohhhh!!
7,Morty,"Oh, geez... I-I can't get that Truth Tortoise out of my head."
8,Rick,"[sits down] Yeah, I told you not to look into its eyes. Hey, Morty, let's watch some Interdimensional Cable. Remember how we used to do that?"
9,Morty,"Rick, I can't-- I can't go on. I-I can't go on like this with the Truth Tortoise shit in my head. I-I wish you could just--"
10,Rick,[nonchalantly] Erase the memory from your mind?
11,Morty,[suspicious] How did you know I was gonna say that?
12,Rick,"Come on, Morty, come with me."
13,Rick,After you.
14,Morty,What the hell is this?!
15,Rick,"This, Morty, is my archive of all the experiences you've begged me to remove from from your life, [puts a purple vial in a section] lest you go insane. I call them ""Morty's Mind Blowers""! [breaks the fourth wall to the camera] And we'll be doing this instead of Interdimensional Cable."
16,Morty,How long have I been asking you to remove memories?
17,Rick,"Since the first [burps] time your mind was blown. [picks up a blue vial] Ah, here it is. [burps] Classic. [blows vial. As Morty comes over, Rick puts the helmet on Morty and has him sit down on the chair] There's no dust on it because this isn't the first time we've done this."
18,Morty,What?!
19,Rick,"I call this ""Moonspiracy""! Ha-ha-ha-ha-hah! [inserts the blue vial into the helmet, presses a button and zoom into Morty's rolled-up eyes--]"
20,Morty,"Huh, wow. That's incredible. [rotates view to the left. A strange figure standing in a mid-stride walking pose gazes at Morty] What the heck?! [the man then smiles sinisterly]"
21,Beth,"Morty, do you realize how ridiculous that sounds?"
22,Rick,"Yeah, pretty crazy story, Morty. [Morty is outraged]"
23,Morty,"Are you serious?! Half the crap we've seen, and you think that sounds crazy?!"
24,Rick,"I've been to 300 versions of Earth's moon, including this one, and I've never seen signs of a ""regular dude,"" as you describe him, hanging out up there."
25,Summer,[uncaring] It's probably just a smudge on the lens.
26,Morty,"Smudge on the lens?! SMUDGE ON THE LENS?!! I know the difference between a man threatening me and a smudge on the goddamn lens, Summer!!"
27,Beth,"Morty, calm down! Are you feeling okay?"
28,Morty,I'M FINE!! [angrily leaves the table and runs upstairs]
29,Beth,So sensitive.
30,Principal Vagina,"Kids, I'd like to introduce you all to our new guidance counselor, Mr. Lunas. [the moon man enters the classroom. Morty drops his pencil in shock]"
31,Mr. Lunas,I look forward to helping guide you all towards a brighter future. I believe every student should... [smiles sinisterly] shoot for the moon. [Morty feels tense for a beat]
32,Morty,"Got you now, you son of a bitch. [takes pictures as Lunas plants flag on a front lawn]"
33,Principal Vagina,What's this?
34,Morty,Proof that Mr. Lunas isn't who he says he is!
35,Principal Vagina,He's not a guidance counselor?
36,Morty,"I-I assume he's qualified to be one, who isn't? But he also lives on the moon!"
37,Principal Vagina,[pause] Okay. Hmm... Is that it? Is he doing anything to hurt anyone?
38,Morty,"Oh, he's up to something."
39,Principal Vagina,"I...think I understand. ""Up to something,"" ""lives on the moon."" Okay, I'll talk to him."
40,Morty,What did he say?
41,Principal Vagina,"Denied the moon stuff, but that's what pedophiles do. They deny, it's their bread and butter."
42,Morty,"""Pedophile""?"
43,Principal Vagina,You don't think so? I thought the moon thing might have been code.
44,Morty,"No, he's literally from the moon!"
45,Principal Vagina,"Well, you saw react. [points] Moon or not, that dude likes 'em young."
46,Marine,"Gordon Lunas was a good Marine. We don't know what drove him to take his own life, but we want to remember the good things. Like how, from a certain angle, some people would say he looked like a smudge. [Morty gapes in horror]"
47,Morty,"Oh, my God, what have I done?! What have I done..?!"
48,Woman,"Primary systems, check."
49,Alien Warlord,"I'm not an unreasonable man, Beth Smith."
50,Rick,"Yes, Morty, come on, you're doing it!"
