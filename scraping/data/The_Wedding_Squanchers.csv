1,Jerry,The trick to cereal is keeping 70% of it above the milk.
2,Beth,"Jerry, get a job."
3,Rick,"Uh, w-why don't you get it Jerry? you're the man of the house and you don't have a job."
4,Jerry,*Sighs and stands up to answer door*
5,Courier Flap,"(In an automated machine voice) Delivery for Rick, Morty, Summer, Beth and Jerry."
6,Summer,"*Drops spoon upon seeing the Courier Flap* Gross, what is that thing?"
7,Rick,"It's a Courier Flap, it's like the Intergalactic version of UPS but less off-putting. *Reaches hand into courier and retrieves a metallic egg-shaped item*"
8,Birdperson's Voice,"Greetings, this is Birdperson."
9,Tammy's Voice,And Tammy!
10,Birdperson's Voice,Inviting you to Planet Squanch for our mate-melding ceremony.
11,Rick,(With disgust) Ughhhh... *places a napkin over the hologram and takes it to the bin in the kitchen)
12,Tammy's Voice,"(Muffled by napkin) If you're not a bird, that means we're getting married!"
13,Summer,Oh my God! My friend Tammy's marrying Birdperson!
14,Jerry,"What the hell is a 'Birdperson,'?"
15,Morty,He's Rick's best friend.
16,Rick,"Uhhhh, l-l-let's not get carried away, Morty."
17,Courier Flaps,Would you like to RSVP or send a gift?
18,Rick,"No. Weddings are basically funerals with cake. If I wanted to watch someone throw their life away, *belch* I'd hang out with Jerry all day."
19,Courier Flap,Affirmative. Returning to sender. *flies towards front door*
20,Beth,"No, hold on, stay... 'Courier Flaps.'"
21,Courier Flap,*Turning back around and re-entering dining room* Staying.
22,Beth,"Dad, you have a friend that's getting married... that's a big deal."
23,Jerry,*Scoffs* it's a big deal he has a friend.
24,Rick,"What do you know about friendship, Jerrrrrry?"
25,Courier Flap,"Confirm, shipping Jerry. *Hovers over Jerry and fully shoves him into underside before flying away through open front door and into sky*"
26,Beth,"Oh God, Jerry?! *Runs to front door*"
27,Summer and Morty,Dad?! *Follow Beth*
28,Beth,*Looking into sky* Where is it taking him?
29,Rick,"*Still eating cereal* I assume Planet Squanch, 6000 lightyears across the galaxy."
30,Morty,Wh?-Wh- th-th-that's insane!
31,Rick,"Yeah, I know. Now we have to go to the wedding."
32,Squanchy,"Rick Sanchez, you psycho bag of Squanch!"
33,Rick,"*Unscrewing and drinking from scotch flask* Hey, what's up, Squanchy?"
34,Summer and Morty,*Morty waves* Heya Squanchy.
35,Squanchy,"Morty, Summer! And you must be Beth. *kissing Beth's hand* Au squanché."
36,Beth,"*Holding a suit in a dry cleaning bag* Your language has 'squanch,' in it a lot. Doesn't that become tedious and worn out like the Smurf thing?"
37,Rick,"Beth, Squanchy culture is more... contextual than literal. You just say what's in your squanch and people understand."
38,Beth,"Oh, okay... I squanch my family."
39,Squanchy,Uhh...
40,Beth,"What? I do, I squanch my family."
41,Squanchy,"Just stop saying it, gross."
42,Jerry,"I'm just saying, we keep acting like there's only two options, but there's not. So, yes, if we went back to earth, as long as Rick was out there, they’d want to interrogate us. But, and this is purely hypothetical, what if we turned your father in to the government?"
43,Beth,"Jerry, so help me god, if you ever bring this up again, no more bacon."
44,Jerry,There already is no more bacon! This world sucks! Our life sucks! Why are we doing this for someone that would never do anything for anyone but himself?
45,Morty,"That's not the point, Dad! We love Rick! F-For the most part."
46,Summer,"Yeah, you don't love people in hopes of a reward, Dad. You love them unconditionally."
47,Beth,"That's very good, kids. I'm proud of you."
48,Jerry,"Okay, so let me get this straight. For the rest of your lives, no matter how much it hurts you, no matter how much it destroys our children's futures, we're gonna do whatever Rick wants, whenever he wants?"
49,All but Jerry,Yes.
50,Jerry,WHY?!
51,Beth,"Because I don't want him to leave again, you dumb asshole!"
52,Rick,"Hey, uh, I was gonna hop over to the Gloppydrop System, get some ice cream."
53,Morty,"You... You want me to come with? I mean, don't you need my brainwaves for camouflage or something?"
54,Rick,"I'll be okay. Bye, Morty."
55,Morty,"Rick? You're not leaving, right?"
56,Rick,"Yeah, I am. To get ice cream."
57,Morty,So you're coming back?
58,Rick,"Morty, if you go to where there’s a bunch of ice cream and then you don’t come back, you haven’t actually gotten ice cream, you’ve just gone where ice cream is."
59,Morty,"Rick, I can handle it if you go, but you'll break mom's heart, and I won't forgive you for that."
60,Rick,"Where's the van, Morty?"
61,Morty,It's over the horizon in the driveway.
62,Operator,"[speaking in an unintelligible language] For English, press 2. [Rick pushes a button.] Connecting to agent."
63,Female Voice,Ongoing investigations.
64,Rick,"Uh, hi. My name is Jerry Smith, I'm from Planet Earth. I know the whereabouts of Rick Sanchez, the wanted criminal."
65,Female Voice,Hold on!
66,Gribbles,This is Special Agent Gribbles. You have a tip about Rick Sanchez?
67,Rick,"Yeah, he kidnapped me and my family, and he left us on Dwarf Terrace-9. He said he was gonna go to the Plim Plom Tavern. And listen."
68,Gribbles,Yes?
69,Rick,"I'm doing what's right for the galaxy by calling you, so if we come back to Earth, can my family have a normal life?"
70,Gribbles,"We only want Sanchez, sir. Your family will be fine."
71,Rick,"Nice, thank you. I'm Jerry Smith, and I enjoy sucking big, sweaty [*bleep*] and licking disgusting furry testicle sacks."
72,Gribbles,"Uh, okay."
