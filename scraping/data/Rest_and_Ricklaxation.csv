1,Girl 1,"So, Jessica, I heard you broke up with Brad."
2,Girl 2,Who are you gonna date; now that you can date anyone?
3,Jessica,"I don’t know. I mean, obviously if someone special comes along. B-But I mean really special, like, nothing I’ve even remotely considered in the past."
4,Morty,(muttering while fixing his hair) Holyshitholyshitholyshit.
5,Girl 1,I want that kind of love like that docking kind of love.
6,Girl 2,"Oh, yeah."
7,Girl 1,"Like, penis in the foreskin kind of love Mm-hmm just, like, warm, just like..."
8,Morty,Hey... (Cough) ah...
9,Rick,"Everybody, fuck off. Morty, I need your help. W-W-W-We We need to go on a quick adventure."
10,Morty,You said I could go to school today.
11,Rick,"That was before I needed something, Morty. There’s a plasma shard in the Abadango Cluster. A princess has it. If I get it, I’ll be awesome."
12,Morty,"We’ve been going non-stop, Rick. It’s not healthy. You know, these are my teenage years. I-I just found out Jessica’s single."
13,Rick,"Oh, that’s Wow, Morty. Wow. What an exciting life you lead. (shoots portal) Let’s go. In and out, 20 minutes adventure."
14,Morty,They’re on our tail!
15,Rick,"Steady, Morty. Five cetons."
16,Morty,Wha!
17,Rick,Fire!
18,Rick,"Pull up, Morty, pull up! Pull up!"
19,Rick and Morty,(sigh)
20,Rick,(continues sighing) Fuck.
21,Morty,(crying)
22,Rick,"(screams) Oh, fuck! Fuck! Ahh! Ahh!"
23,Morty,I can’t fucking do this anymore!
24,Rick,That was seriously fucked up. We almost died.
25,Morty,So you agree?
26,Rick,Fuck yes! That w... T-This was insane! That was pure luck. I was not in control of that situation at all.
27,Morty,(continues crying)
28,Rick,"(notices his hands shaking) Look at this, Morty. Look at my fucking hand. Look at this shit."
29,Morty,Why do you... Keep doing this to us?!
30,Rick,"I don’t know, Morty. Maybe I hate myself, maybe I think I deserve to die. I-I-I-I don’t I don’t know!"
31,Morty,(cries again)
32,Rick,We need a vacation.
33,Rick,Isn’t that something?
34,Morty,You were right. Best day spa in the galaxy. 
35,Rick,"It's not even cruel, either. These things are just doing what they do in the wild. It loves swallowing stressed-out creatures for 20 minutes and then puking them up."
36,Morty,My whole body’s like a baby’s ass.
37,Alien,"Complimentary psychological detox? Removes all your cognitive toxins, (clears throat) purifies your system. "
38,Rick,"Oof, this guy on commission or something?"
39,Morty,I don’t think. Are you on commission?
40,Alien,We’re not on (gurgle) commission. We get (gurgle) paid by the hour. There’s no incentive really-
41,Rick,"(Annoyed) Oh, my god. Okay, listen. W-W-W-We’ll try the machine, but but I’d like you to try something. Try swallowing the giant ball of snot that’s dangling around in the back of your throat. (Throws drink on the ground while getting in the aliens face) It’s disgusting. Nobody wants to hear that. Ahem. Ahem! That’s"
42,Morty,(Grabs Rick by the arm and drags him into the room)
43,Rick,"Wow, did you hear me bite that guy's head off? Geez, I really need to chill. "
44,Morty,Maybe you should go through
45,Rick,"All right, mister comedy man, you don’t have to bust my balls. You’re not helping things."
46,Morty,"Rick, is this thing supposed to be making this no-"
47,Toxic Rick,(He stands up and shouts out for Morty.) Morty!
48,Toxic Morty,(Toxic Morty is seen almost completely sunk inside the mud.) (Waves his hand weakly to get Rick's attention.) R-Rick.
49,Toxic Rick,Morty! (He walks up to Toxic Morty and forcefully grabs him and yanks Morty out and back onto his feet.)
50,Toxic Morty,Ugh! What Happened?
51,Toxic Rick (Yelling at scared Toxic Morty),"We blew up, idiot! Are you really that stupid? Obviously the guy I yelled at overloaded the machine. It takes more than that to kill Rick and Morty, motherfucker! "
52,Toxic Rick,"But this might do it. Run, Morty! "
53,Toxic Morty,E-Everything hurts! 
54,Toxic Rick,"That’s because you’re worthless! (He steps on a creature’s face that’s in the muck, killing it.) Jesus, how big was this explosion? I’m a genius. I don’t have time for this shit."
55,Toxic Morty,"(Scared, in the fetal position) W-W-We’re in Hell, aren’t we, Rick? "
56,Toxic Rick,"(Points at Toxic Morty, yelling at him.) You’re so stupid, Morty. You’re an (Belches) idiot. There’s no such thing as Hell. "
57,Toxic Morty,"I believe you, but I just want to die. "
58,Toxic Rick,You can die when I say so. I control you. I control the universe! Why am I bragging about that? I have nothing to prove. I’m surrounded by inferior pieces of shit and – 
59,Toxic Rick,"Toxins. We’re not in Hell, Morty. (Looks around) We’re in the detoxifier. The machine didn’t blow up. It worked normally. (Wipes goo off of his arm) It removed our toxins. (He grabs Toxic Morty's face.) We’re the toxins. "
60,Toxic Morty,(Starts screaming in terror) Aaaaaaaahhhhhhh!
61,Toxic Rick,"Are you listening, you stupid little garbage person?! (Shakes Toxic Morty) We're what got removed! "
62,Alien,I hope you both found that detox sufficiently relaxing. 
63,Rick,"Hey, man, listen Those comments I made about your throat? "
64,Alien,(Clears throat and swallows.) (Puts his hands up.) It’s all good. 
65,Rick,"It’s nice of you to let me off the hook. It’s still unacceptable behavior, and I do regret it. "
66,Alien,"Believe me, man, I’ve been working here a long time. I get it."
67,Morty,"Hey, uh, you mind if I put on some music? "
68,Rick,Not at all. 
69,Radio,Grab my terrifolds...
70,Rick,What
71,Morty,I just hit shuffle. 
72,Rick,Are you kidding? 
73,Morty,Haha.
74,Rick,"This universe. (Burps) Oh, excuse me. "
75,Morty,We should listen to one random song a
76,Rick,That is an interesting concept. You
77,Morty,"Hoo, if anyone could, Rick. "
78,Rick,"Hey, here’s"
79,Morty,"Thanks, Rick. I love you."
80,Toxic Rick,"Yeah, motherfucker! Yeah! Get it! Get some! Right up your fucking bitch ass, you fuck! Guess who just discovered a new element?! You think you could do that, Morty? You think anyone but me could do that ever in a billion years? Do you think if God existed he could do it? The answer is no. If God exists, it’s fucking me!"
81,Toxic Morty,"Yes, Rick. I-I agree, Rick."
82,Toxic Rick,"While you were flapping your parasitic turd holster, I discovered the toxic equivalent of electricity, Morty. What do you think about that? "
83,Toxic Morty,Uh I th-I think my voice is annoying.
84,Toxic Rick,"It is, and it’s your best quality."
85,Toxic Morty,(Sad) So true.
86,Mr. Goldenfold,"Now, who can tell me the common denominator of these two factions? You don’t know or y’all just bored? "
87,Morty,"Hey, listen, you know, wh-If we’re all bored over here, wouldn’t the common denominator be you? "
88,Mr. Goldenfold,"Damn, Morty. That’s hilarious. Normally I would come down on any kind of disruption, but it seems to represent a positive change for your character. Class dismissed! "
89,Off screen student,"Awesome, Morty!"
90,Student with glasses,"You done good, Morty. (High fives him.)"
91,Off screen student 2,Oh yeah!
92,Female student,"Thanks for the advice, Morty."
93,Morty,You got it.
94,Female student 2,"I did it, Morty! "
95,Morty,I knew you could.
96,Mitch,"Hey, Morty, remember yesterday when I couldn’t play the trombone? Well, check this out! (Plays a tune on his trombone.)"
97,Morty,"(Snapping his fingers) Just like I told you, Mitch. The music was in your heart the whole time."
98,Female student looking into her mirror,Stupid hat Wish I had the courage to just be myself.
99,Female Student,(Smiles) There you are.
100,Bully,"You might have all these idiots fooled, but I know you’re still the same pathetic loser hiding behind a confident facade. I know that because I’m doing the same thing, brother. I’m not alone anymore! "
101,Jessica,"Hey, Morty. Word around school is you’ve become super healthy."
102,Morty,"I don’t know about all that. I do, however, know that I have a pretty bad case of haven’t taken you to dinner-itis. Might be fatal. Hahaha!"
103,Rick,(Walks up to Morty and Jessica)
104,Morty,"Happy to help, Rick."
105,Rick,"I hate to bug you with this, but after our morning hike I started receiving very faint, highly unusual transmissions on my sub ether phone. Listen."
106,Morty,"It’s a bad phone. Chuck it. I downgraded to a clamshell for emergencies only. You know, if if if something’s worth saying, I-it’s worth eye contact."
107,Rick,"Uh, I-I-I traced the source of the call back to the spa we went to, Morty. I thought I could hear a voice in there, so I enhanced it, a-and listen."
108,Toxic Rick,"Hey, asshole! "
109,Toxic Morty,"Oh, man! "
110,Toxic Rick,Remember us? 
111,Toxic Morty,"Oh, I don’t like confrontation! "
112,Toxic Rick,"You fucked us, you pieces of garbage! That’s right, you’re fucking garbage, not us. I’m a fucking genius and a god. You really think this thing can hold me? I’m gonna rip your throat... "
113,Rick,"Morty, what if the toxic parts of us have their own identities, their own will to live? "
114,Rick,W-What if mine shares my intelligence and devised a way to reach out to us? 
115,Morty,"Sounds like he’s in a lot of pain. Lot. O. Pain. But, you know, you shouldn’t have to deal with that, man. You know, l-let’s work off your trauma with some urban spin yoga. It’s amazing. You do yoga on a bike, but you have an at-risk preteen-"
116,Rick," I don’t think I can just blow this off, Morty. If I had known it worked this way, I wouldn’t have detoxed. Well, I would have because I was toxic. Now I’m detoxed and I’m accountable to my toxins, right? I-It’s a dilemma."
117,Morty,I think I know what to do. (Grabs Rick's phone and breaks it in half.)
118,Rick,Morty!
119,Morty,"Rick! Haha. (Hops off the car.) You know, the only problem here is a big fat brain that misses eating all them big fat problems. Focus on the good thing. Trust me, things are good. Taking that away from me, heh. That wouldn’t be healthy."
120,Morty,"Hahaha! Hahahaha! Oh, man. World’s Greatest Grandpa, for reals. (Walks away.) It’s not just a coffee cup for you, bud. You’re legit. (Catches a football that was kicked towards him, and chucks it back to an off screen person.)"
121,Morty,I love drums. I never took drum lessons. Why? Limitations. We are addicted to our own limitations. How amazing is that? Is the kale prepared in the kitchen? I’ll have a water. 
122,Jessica,"Uh How is the ""cru-dite?"" "
123,Waiter,CruditÃ©. It’s a cup of carrot sticks.
124,Morty,Ha! It’s okay! Pronounce it however you want. Words are just things. Please. Thank you. We’re having a conversation.
125,Morty,"God, I am so excited to finally have dinner with you. You know how long I’ve been waiting for this? It’s like, whew! I-I-I wish you’d shut up, though. Just kidding. You know, you’re so quiet. What’s wrong? W-Why don’t you tell me about yourself? What’s the atmosphere like on planet Jessica? Where’s the equator, what are the vacations, a-and the holidays? I mean, you know, haha, are they the same time? Talk to me."
126,Jessica,Well I... like this restaurant.
127,Morty,"Holy shit! Holy shit! We have a moron over here! I’m an idiot. I can’t believe I haven’t thought of this. You have to do this detox thing I did. It’s an alien spa, you go through it, fwoos-s-s-ssh, lasers, bwaa-bwaa-bwaa, wheeew wheeew! Sucks everything out. Everything that was holding me back, everything bad, I mean, it just sluuuurp! Hahaha! Right? "
128,Jessica,"(Awkwardly) Cooooool. (She grabs her phone and looks at it. It's out of battery.) Oh, my God! I can’t believe this."
129,Morty,"Yeah, phones are awful, I downgraded to- (Goes to grab her phone but she interrupts him.) "
130,Jessica,"I totally forgot my I have a thing, and... "
131,Morty,Things are good.
132,Jessica,"You know what? Why am I doing that? That’s more rude than the truth. Look, I’m sorry, Morty. I just don’t think... "
133,Morty,Do not. Even. You have no need to explain. It’s all good. 
134,Jessica,I think you’d get bored with me. (Gets up out of her chair and leaves.)
135,Morty,"E-Exactly. Look, the sparks aren’t flying. This is what dating is for, you know? First date, no sparks. No damage, no worries. Life is a highway. We’re gonna ride it all night lonnngg! "
136,Morty," Gonna eat some ""crudite. Mmm! Is this organic? Mmm. (He looks around the restaurant.) All right. You know, the evening continues. (His attention is on this one girl who's sitting at the bar.) Okay, here we go."
137,Morty,"Ma’am, I’m afraid I have some bad news for you. Your money’s no good here. Haha! (To the Bar tender) I’ll I’ll get the next round, sir."
138,Stacy,Aren’t you a child? 
139,Morty,Only in the ways that matter. Morty.
140,Stacy,(Sigh.) Stacy.
141,Morty,"I’ve been watching you drink, Stacy. I get the feeling you’ve got a hard job. I wonder what it takes to please you. That’s the job I want Part time, full time, I want to be good at it, bad at it, I want to get promoted, fired, corner office, hostile takeover, workplace accident I’m on my knees, Stacy. Praying, worshipping, begging, whatever you want. (Sniff) What do you think about that? "
142,Stacy,(Turns to look at Morty.) Okay. Fuck it.
143,Morty,Tink.
144,Morty,(Kisses Stacy) Mm! Let’s ask my grandpa. He’s a scientist.
145,Morty,"Hey, Rick, are you familiar with ""Ben Wa"" technology? "
146,Rick,"(Get's up.) Morty, great news. I went back to the spa and they let me purchase the containment unit from their detoxifier."
147,Morty,Why? 
148,Toxic Rick,"(On the screen that's connected to the containment unit.) Because we’re coming home, bitch! "
149,Morty,What is this? 
150,Toxic Rick,"This is the parts of your pussy grandpa that keep it real. Oh oh, and I think you dropped something, too! (He grabs Toxic Morty.)"
151,Toxic Morty,"I don’t want to be on camera. I’m ugly and gross, please."
152,Stacey,Should I go? 
153,Morty,"You’re your own person, Stacy. "
154,Stacy,Then I’d like to stay.
155,Morty,"Rick, please tell me you’re not trying to put that stuff back inside of us."
156,Rick,"Morty, I’m sorry. That stuff is alive and it belongs with us. We yanked them from their homes and locked them in a can. (Knocks on the containment unit, knocking Toxic Rick over.)"
157,Toxic Rick,Motherfucker! 
158,Rick,See? They’re living in pain.
159,Morty,"That’s what they do, Rick, they live in pain. They are pain, you know? They they’re all the bad parts of us, which, by the way, includes our dishonesty, so how do you know this isn’t all some sort of crazy trick?"
160,Toxic Rick,"Oh, so now because I’m made entirely of toxins I’m also a liar? Fuck you, you little sociopath. (Grabs Toxic Morty again.)  You hear this, Morty? "
161,Toxic Morty,"Oh, everybody hates me. I can tell. Y-You all hate me. "
162,Toxic Rick,"(Puts him back down.) All right, shut up, Morty. Healthy Rick, are we doing this or what? "
163,Rick,"Yep. Sorry, Morty. I need you to step into the booth. (Opens the door to the booth.)"
164,Morty,(Shakes his head with his arms crossed.)
165,Toxic Rick,"Don’t negotiate with that little turd, dummy. You’re the Rick. You need to show dominance. Morty, booth, now. (Toxic Rick grabs Toxic Morty and shoves him into the booth. He gets in too, and closes the door.)"
166,Rick,"Booth! Come on, Morty."
167,Morty,Don’t touch me! 
168,Rick,"Morty, do the healthy thing and voluntarily retoxify yourself. (Rick grabs Morty as they both struggle.)"
169,Morty,Nooooo! 
170,Stacy,Is it wrong if I think this is kind of hot? 
171,Morty,"Let me out of here! Stacy, help! Open the door! "
172,Stacy,"I need to hear our safe word, Morty."
173,Morty,Sea Cucumber! Sea Cucumber! 
174,Rick,What are you doing? 
175,Stacy,"I’ll do anything for you, Morty."
176,Rick,No!
177,Toxic Rick,It worked! Haha! Yes! That idiot believed every word. Now let’s see how he enjoys living in that shit tank.
178,Toxic Rick,"He’s right behind me, isn’t he? (Looks behind him.)"
179,Toxic Morty,He’s in front of you.
180,Toxic Rick,Oh. (Rubs eyes.) My eyes are still adjusting.
181,Stacy,"(Through the screen.) Uh, is this like a sex dungeon? I guess I should’ve been paying attention."
182,Toxic Rick,"After 70 years of being bottled up inside a (Burp) sentimental jackass, I finally get to live my own life."
183,Rick,You said we were merging.
184,Toxic Rick,"I lied, dumbass! I lie about everything! Why would I ever re-merge with a pussy like you? "
185,Rick,So you were just gonna trap us in that tank? T-That was your plan? 
186,Toxic Rick,"Not was, motherfucker, still is."
187,Morty,"(Points to Toxic Rick.) Kill him, Rick! "
188,Toxic Morty,(Hides behind the door to the booth.) I don’t like this! This is scary! 
189,Rick,"(Gets up, ready to fight with his fists up.) All right, you asked for it."
190,Toxic Rick,"Did I ask for this? (Kicks Rick in the crotch. Rick groans in pain, grabbing his crotch.) Did I ask for this? (Grabs Rick's shoulders and repeatedly knees him in the crotch.) Huh? Did I? "
191,Groin System 6000,Assessing threat to groin.
192,Toxic Rick,Groin System 6000. Kill him! 
193,Groin System 6000,"(Faces Rick, then looks back.) That... is my groin’s user."
194,Toxic Rick,"Believe me, I got a lot more use out of that thing than he ever did."
195,Groin System 6000,You know what? Not my table. (Turns back into a belt buckle.)
196,Mrs. Pancakes,You do know me.
197,Summer,(Gasp.)
198,Summer,"What the hell, Grandpa Rick? "
199,Toxic Rick,"Fuck you, Summer! "
200,Rick,"Sorry, Summer! "
201,Rick,"Okay, okay, take it easy. Don’t do it."
202,Toxic Rick,I love you. Good boy. Daddy’s little boy.
203,Rick,"Summer, get out of here! Go! "
204,Toxic Rick,"Oh, who’s that? "
205,Toxic Rick,"(Burp) Who’s that over there? Oh, no."
206,Toxic Rick,"You see the bad man in front of you? You’re a good little boy, you’re gonna get him. You’re gonna get him."
207,Toxic Rick,"Ahh! Son of a... (He runs up to a bookshelf, pushing the books over to find a book that scans him and opens up to give him the same type of injection gun. He injects himself and shoots it at the monster, right before the injection he got took effect and a naked baby Rick bursts through his chest, killing him. It grows to Rick's normal age.) (The monster alien turns around and runs towards Rick, right before naked toxic Rick bursts through it, killing it.)"
208,Toxic Rick,"Nice try, asshole."
209,Rick,We can resolve (Huff) our issues. We don’t need to resort to over-the-top- Aah! 
210,Toxic Morty,"I-I did it, Rick. I got the tank! I-I’m a piece of shit, but I got the tank! "
211,Toxic Rick,"You’re going in that tank, motherfucker. You’re gonna (burp) live in that toxic shit wasteland like I had to do! "
212,Toxic Morty,Ahh! Ow! (Toxic Morty can't control the ship as it starts crashing all around the living room.) (Rick and Toxic Rick duck to avoid it. It eventually jams into a wall.)
213,Toxic Rick,"That’s right, motherfucker! You’re going in that fucki- "
214,Beth,(Confused) Dads? 
215,Rick,"Okay, just Just leave her out of it."
216,Beth,What’s going on? 
217,Toxic Rick,"All right, fuck this. Time for plan B If I can’t trap you in a toxic world, (Climbs up to the ship, grabs Morty and throws him out.)"
218,Morty,Ahh!
219,Toxic Rick,"I’ll just make the whole world toxic. (Flips Rick off and crashes the spaceship through the roof, flying away.)"
220,Rick,"It’s okay, girls. I-I’m so sorry I put us in danger with some of my behavior. I-If you’d like I can go out in the g-garden, pick some fresh basil, and make us a nice Scallopini."
221,Beth,What did the booger version of you mean when he said he was going to make the whole world toxic? 
222,Rick,"Believe me, sweetie, that man’s motivations are a mystery."
223,Morty,"Screw that, Rick. We got to stop him. What’s the last thing you’d think about doing with that tank thing? "
224,Rick,"(Walks up to Morty and bends down near him) Morty, I appreciate what you’re trying to do, but it’s not our place, you know, to pick and choose which world gets saved from what apocalypse. Our our toxins have as much a right to their worldview as-"
225,Rick,"Morty, how is it healthy to slap me? "
226,Morty,"Obviously my version of health is a hell of a lot different from yours, you useless old turd."
227,Rick,Wait. That’s it. (Gets back up.)  How could that detox machine know the difference between healthy and sick for everything that goes through it? It can’t. It must be by the individual’s own definition of toxicity. That means... 
228,Beth,Dad! 
229,Morty,"What the What the hell, Rick? "
230,Rick,(Grabs Morty and runs.) I’ll explain on the way.
231,Toxic Rick,"This ""Moon Tower,"" Morty, (Burps) is the perfect height and metallic composition for the (burps) amplification and beaming of toxic energies. What do you think about that, Morty? Are you excited about that, Morty? "
232,Toxic Morty,"Oh, man. I’m just freaked out. I-It’s too high up here."
233,Toxic Rick,"Once I flip this switch, the entire world is gonna be just as toxic as us, baby. (He pulls the lever.)"
234,Priest,As we praise our loving Father- 
235,Priest,(Rips off his shirt.) God is a lie! We made him up for money! 
236,Man,"(Takes off the mouse head.) Santa Claus isn’t real. (Kicks a boy into the pool right before the kids start stabbing the guy with forks and knifes, as he bleeds everywhere.) You were all mistakes! "
237,Toxic Rick,"Hahahahahaha! We fucking did it, Morty. Put your fucking hands in the air.  (Grabs Toxic Morty's arm and lifts it.) Yeah, you little piece of shit."
238,Rick,Remember me? 
239,Toxic Rick,Didn’t you learn last time that you can’t beat me? 
240,Rick,"Yeah, I did. And then I learned something else. (Pulls a gun out of his lab coat.) This."
241,Toxic Morty,Ahh!! 
242,Rick,"That bullet is laced with an encrypted nanobotic virus that will disintegrate your Morty in about, ah, 20 minutes."
243,Toxic Rick,You think I give a shit? 
244,Rick,"I know you give a shit, dummy. Because I know I don’t. Here’s another thing I know. The decryption key that neutralizes the virus. (He pulls put an injection with a tube to the other injection part.) You want it? Come and get it. Merge with me and you’ll know how to save him."
245,Toxic Rick,"Pfft. Come on, man. I’ve been trapped in your pussy brain for 70 years of delusions, but this is the all-time weakest bluff that I’ve ever-"
246,Toxic Morty,Ow-Ohh!! 
247,Toxic Rick,(Dodges the bullet.) Jesus Christ! What are you doing?! 
248,Morty,He’s cutting your time in half. 10 minutes.
249,Toxic Morty,Ohh! It hurts! 
250,Toxic Rick,What is your problem? 
251,				Rick,"Oh, I had all my problems removed my entitlement, my narcissism, my crippling loneliness, my irrational attachments."
252,Rick,"They must be somewhere. They ain’t over here, bro."
253,Toxic Rick,I’m not going back in there! 
254,Rick,"Honestly, I don’t care either way. I hate having you in me. And when I say ""honestly"" you can believe it, because we both know I’m too healthy to lie. Watch."
255,Toxic Rick,"All right! Knock it off! You’re not impressing anyone. (He kneels down and holds Toxic Morty.) Morty, not that I give a shit, but are you okay? "
256,Toxic Morty,"Jesus Christ, it hurts."
257,Toxic Rick,"Relax, quit your bitching. Y-You’re gonna be fine. Grandpa’s here."
258,Rick,Hahahahahaha.
259,Toxic Rick,You think that’s funny? 
260,Rick,"Y-You got to have a sense of humor about these things. Oh, wait, you can’t. You’re literally incapable of seeing the bigger picture. I guess it’s just funny because you’ve never done anything but complain about me being in charge, but if I ever gave you the wheel we’d be dead in five minutes."
261,Toxic Morty,"Ah, Rick?"
262,Rick,"You poor, dumb, sick animal."
263,Toxic Morty,Augh... Rick?
264,Toxic Rick,"Ahh! (Gets up and walks towards Rick.) Just do it! Just do it, you piece of-"
265,Rick,"Aaahhh! I’m back, baby! (Dances around.) Regular Rick! Master of both worlds! Check it it out! (Farts in Morty's face.) Excuse me. (Walks up to the lever.) Now we’ll just reverse this hacky toxicity beam. Man, I really over think shit when I’m angry."
266,Priest,God is not a lie.
267,Crying boy,Mommy! Mommy!
268,Rick,"(Looking around with binoculars.) Ha! All right, Morty, now it’s time we re-merge your little ass."
269,Morty,"You’re a better man than me, Rick. I’m healthy enough to admit that! "
270,Rick,That kid is a real piece of shit.
271,Toxic Morty,"(Moaning in pain.) Y-Y-You’re gonna save me, right? "
272,Rick,"(Picks up Toxic Morty.) Part of me wanted to, Toxic Morty. Part of me really wanted to. (He sticks the injection into Toxic Morty.)"
273,Worker,"(On the phone.) I’m telling you, these shares are hot."
274,Morty,"(Also on the phone.) Duane, Duane, Duane, I get it, now can you get me? Have I ever lied to you? (Grabs an apple on his desk.) That’s right, and ask around, I never do, Duane."
275,Morty,"Let me put this real simple. This stock is a beautiful redhead, recently single, not looking to date but ready to fall in love, and fate has put her locker two down from yours, Duane Two lockers down. (Winks at two female workers. They both giggle.) So step up or step off, Duane. Blue pill or red pill, what’ll be, bro? Totally understand, Duane. You’re the boss. (Stops the call.) Heinholz Biotech Million and a half at thirty-three. (Bites the apple as everyone cheers and throws their papers.)"
276,Worker in a red shirt,(Catches the apple.) Heh.You little fucking monster.
277,Morty,"Mmm! Is this organic? Mmm! (Morty's phone rings, and he answers, as he walks up to his window at the view.) Go for Morty."
278,Jessica on the phone,"Hi, Morty. It’s Jessica. Look, can we just talk for a minute? "
279,Morty,Is that how long it takes for Rick to trace my location? 
280,Jessica,"Come back, Morty. I miss you."
281,Morty,You miss the old me. You miss someone that loved you so much you never had to love ‘em back.
282,Jessica,How do you know I don’t want to love you? 
283,Morty,Because I’m not sick. (Presses a button.)
284,Jacquelyn,(Sits at the bench.) Ex-girlfriend? Should I be jealous? 
285,Morty,(Puts his phone on the bench.) There’s nothing to be jealous of.
286,Jacquelyn,(Sigh) I just realized that I’m scheduled to speak at that fundraiser on our date night. I can cancel.
287,Morty,We’ll be together. That’s a date.
288,Jacquelyn,"You are the perfect man. (Notices Morty's phone.) Oh, sweetie, (Picks it up to show Morty.) I think you hit the wrong button. You didn’t hang up."
289,Morty,Huh. How ‘bout that? 
290,Rick,"Sorry, tiny American Psycho, (Holds up the injection.) time to take the opposite of your medicine."
291,Morty,Do what you got to do.
292,Morty,"Oh! Ow! Ahh! (Eventually, Morty gets up.)"
293,Jessica,"So, how do you feel, Morty? "
294,Morty,"Ah, geez. I’m miserable."
295,Rick,Am I good or what? 
296,Morty,"I guess it’s worth it, though, to know how much you care."
297,Jessica,"Care? Me? Morty, I’m fine with you. I only did this for him. (Points at Rick.)"
298,Rick,"You lying bitch. She kept coming to our house, Morty, and kept asking me. ""Did did d-did you get a new Morty yet?"" "
299,Jessica,Because you kept drunk dialing me and crying about it.
300,Rick,I wasn’t crying! 
301,Morty,"Jacquelyn, I I-I-I wasn’t who I said I was."
302,Jacquelyn,You weren’t a 14-year-old boy from the Midwest who ran away from his family and capitalized on his lack of conscience by becoming a stock broker? 
303,Morty,"Oh. I guess I was pretty up front about that, wasn’t I? "
304,Jacquelyn,You were up front about everything. You were my soul mate.
305,Morty,"Well No-Not anymore. I’ll, um Y-You can keep the apartment, and and and, uh the drones."
306,Rick,She can’t keep the drones. They turn into a little Voltron robot. They’re awesome.
307,Rick,You can’t keep the drones.
308,Girl 1,"So, how was your date with Brad? "
309,Jessica,It wasn’t a date. We were just having lunch.
310,Girl 2,"You guys are getting back together, aren’t you? "
311,Morty,"(Looks down, sad.)"
312,Rick,"(Comes out of nowhere.) Morty, I need your help on an adventure. Eh, ""need"" is a strong word. We need door stops, but a brick would work, too."
313,Morty,Okay.
314,Jessica,Morty.
315,Morty,(Morty stops and looks at Jessica and smiles.)
316,Jessica,Good to have you back.
317,Girl 1,"Have you ever been peed on before? Oh, my God. Yum."
318,Credits song,"Hey, did you ever want to hold a terrifold? I got one right here Grab my terri-flap Squeeze it Grab it, squeeze it Tug on my terri-flap Hey, I want to take you to The terrifold dance Wanna come with me? You can grab my holdie-folds Squeeze ‘em tight You son of a bitch. Suck my holdie-flappy folds Lick my flappy foldie-holes My terri-flaps in your mouth Suck my flaps, you piece of shit. Whoo!"
319,Man,"Although only a handful of moon towers remain today, they were popular in the late 19th century. An entire town could be illuminated by... (He sees the containment unit.)  What the hell is this? (Out of curiosity, he presses a button, releasing toxin gas, and slimey Stacy. The man backs away, and accidentally falls off the tower, screaming all the way down.)"
320,Stacey,Sea Cucumber! Sea Cucumber!!
