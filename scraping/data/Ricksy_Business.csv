1,Summer,"Bye, mom! Bye, dad!"
2,Morty,Drive carefully!
3,Rick,"Have fun, you two."
4,Beth,"Yes, we will have as much fun as possible on our... (Sarcastic and moody) Titanic-themed getaway."
5,Jerry,"(Finishes packing the car, and closes the door of the car.) Let's lose the 'tude, please. It's supposed to be romantic. (Opens the passenger seat door.)"
6,Beth,"Speaking of disasters, dad, we are leaving you in charge, here."
7,Rick,"I know, c-can we wrap this up? Morty and I (belching) have some synthetic laser-eels oxidizing in the garage."
8,Beth,"(Angry) Hey, don't blow me off. I am drawing a line, okay? Any damage to this house or these children when we get back, and... no more adventures with Morty. (Opens the car door off screen.)"
9,Morty,"Aw, geez, Rick! If my mom's the one who's saying it, then you know it's pretty serious this time."
10,Beth and Jerry in unison,That's right.
11,Jerry,Wait... What?
12,Rick,"Listen, you have my word as a caregiver, everything's gonna be fine. And if not, like you say, no more adventures or whatever. It's like that old song ""blomp blomp-a noop noop a-noop noop noop"". You guys know that song? (Elbows Morty.) From Tiny Roger's? You never heard of it? You know, the black effeminate guy from the '50s?"
13,Rick,"No-nobody? (Angry) A-all right, whatever. Look, who cares? Just go on your stupid trip."
14,Jerry,(Serious) Not one thing out of place.
15,Jerry,Not a single thing.
16,Summer,"(Happy) Well, we're past the point of no return. I'm going to have a party."
17,Summer,(Off screen) I found Jello.
18,Summer,"Can you sneak your mom's vodka? Yes, she does. I saw it in your laundry room. (Grabs another box) Listen, you can't both be in denial about it. Okay, bye. (Stops the call)"
19,Morty,"Summer, you can't throw a party! Remember what mom said?"
20,Summer,"Yeah, if anything gets messed up, you and grandpa Rick get punished. I'm only a human being, Morty."
21,Morty,"Rick, tell Summer she can't have a party!"
22,Rick,"(Pulls out a tray with canapes on it, and places it on the bench off screen.) Uh, Summer, you can't have a party."
23,Summer,Ugh.
24,Rick,"(Back on screen.) Because (burp) I'm having a party, b-I-I-I-itch! (burp)"
25,Morty,"Oh, what?! Rick, you can't!"
26,Summer,What do you mean you're having a party? (Sarcastic) Are some glip glops from the third dimension going to come over and play cards or something?
27,Rick,"""Glip glop?""  You're lucky a Traflorkian doesn't hear you say that."
28,Summer,Is that like their n-word?
29,Rick,"It's like the n-word and the c-word had a baby, and it was raised by all the bad words for Jews. (Drinks from a soda can.)"
30,Morty,"Listen, I think the three of us could just, you know, have a nice time, like just hanging out, and, you know, doing a little bonding and -- "
31,Summer,(Interrupts Morty) screw that. This is my chance to gain some footing with the cool kids.
32,Rick,"That's why you party? Boy, you really are 17."
33,Summer,Why do you party?
34,Rick,"To get (burp) wr-wriggedy wriggedy wrecked, son!"
35,Summer,Just keep your sci-fi friends away from my awesome ones.
36,Rick,"Yeah, and you keep your awesome friends away from my canapes. (Places a piece of food into his canapes to finish preparing them.)"
37,Tour Guide,"After dinner, Titanic 2 will attach to the rail system near our replica iceberg, and the hydraulics encased in these tubes will execute a controlled sink into the icy depths."
38,Jerry,A rail system seems archaic for an attraction this impressive. Are you sure the ship will sink?
39,Tour Guide,"I can assure you the ship will sink, as it has a thousand times before. It is un-unsinkable."
40,Jerry,"(Notices the front of the Titanic, full of people.) Ooh! Look, it's the line for the bow!"
41,Beth,"(Bored and unimpressed) Jerry, I'd love to just kick back with a Margarita and read. "
42,Beth,"Do you mind if I skip the whole ""king of the world"" bit?"
43,Jerry,"Well, it's not the ""king of the world"" bit. That's Jack and fabrizio. (Grabs Beth's hat and places it on her head.) This is where rose says, ""I'm flying, Jack!"" But whatever. I can be the only one to do it alone."
44,Beth,"(Looks to her right, and smiles.) Well, what about her?"
45,Beth,"Excuse me, ma'am. Would you like to take my place in line?"
46,Lucy,"(Shy) I, uh -- I could get into trouble."
47,Beth,(Takes off her hat and places it onto Lucy's.) We won't tell.
48,Jerry,So... You're a Titanic fanatic?
49,Lucy,"Oh, yes. I've worked here since it opened, but I've never been able to participate."
50,Jerry,Happy to help... rose.
51,Tammy,"(To a girl) I love watching bukkake. I mean, like, I don't know if I personally would ever do it..."
52,Summer,Brad! Hey!
53,Brad,Yo.
54,Tammy,"(To the girl) Brad is here! Quick, make my hair look drunk."
55,Brad,Check it out. Tammy's already drunk. Cool.
56,Birdperson,The beacon was activated. Who is in danger?
57,Summer,Ugh! Grandpa!
58,Rick,Birdperson!
59,Birdperson,I am pleased there is no emergency.
60,Rick,"Oh, there's an emergency, all right. (He puts his arm around Birdperson) A pussy emergency! When's the last time you got laid, 'pers?"
61,Birdperson,It has been a... challenging mating season for birdperson.
62,Rick,"Then it's time to get your beak wet tonight, playah. (Leads Birdperson into the house) Go have some fun out there birdp-- bird-- birdperson."
63,Morty,"Oh, man, how many people did you invite, Rick?"
64,Rick,"Uh... people? Mm, six."
65,Rick,"Yo! What up, my glip glops?!"
66,Morty,"Oh, man!"
67,Morty,"(Walking around picking up trash from the ground and putting it in a garbage bag. The house is very crowded) (Huff) (Huff) Oh! Y-y-you know there's a garbage, right?"
68,Morty,"Hey, uh, what the hell?!"
69,Jelly-like creature with items stuck inside of it,Ooh. That's why you never invite a floopy doop and a shmoopy doop to the same party. (Exits the room)
70,Morty,"Oh, oh, g-- oh, that's disgusting! You guys are in my parents' bed!"
71,Blue alien,Oh. Sorry. I'm not feeling too well. I just needed to lie down for a bit.
72,Morty,Oh. Okay. S-s-sorry. Haha.
73,Morty,"Oh, my God! Are you kidding me?!"
74,Gearhead,The thing people don't realize about the Gear Wars is that it was never really about the gears at all.
75,Rick,"Uh-huh. Yeah. No, no, to-totally."
76,Morty,"Rick, you got to stop --"
77,Rick,Morty! Have you met Gearhead?
78,Morty,"(Waves) Hey, how's it --"
79,Rick,"(Interrupts Morty) Morty here, he -- he would love to hear all about the Gear Wars. (Rick quickly leaves them)"
80,Gearhead,"How familiar are you with the Gear Wars, exactly?"
81,Morty,Uh... Not at all.
82,Gearhead,"Oh, boy. I envy you. Okay, it was about 754 years ago..."
83,Rick,"Oh, hey, Morty! H-have you -- have you met my buddy scropon?"
84,Morty,"Not again, Rick. That last guy droned on for 20 minutes, you know? And meanwhile, the whole house is being destroyed!"
85,Rick,"Whoa, Morty, this guy's entire planet was destroyed."
86,Rick,Have a little perspective.
87,Squanchy,"Hey, Rick, squanchy party, bro!"
88,Rick,Aw! Squanchy!
89,Squanchy,Is there a good place for me to squanch around here?
90,Rick,"Squanchy, you can squanch wherever you want, man. Mi casa es su casa, dawg!"
91,Squanchy,"All right! I like your squanch! (He runs away, excited)"
92,Morty,"Uh, Rick, what exactly is ""squanching""?"
93,Rick,"Morty, listen -- we've had a lot of really cool adventures over the last year, but it's time to relax."
94,Morty,"Yeah, if I relax now, there might not even be any more adventures!"
95,Rick,"Jesus, Morty, you're bumming me out. Can't we just pretend like everything's fine for a few hours, enjoy ourselves, and then worry about all this later?"
96,Morty,"Yeah, that's easy for you to say, Rick. You know, you like not caring about stuff. You know, wh-wh-what's in this for me?"
97,Morty,(In slow motion) Jessica.
98,Rick,"Knock it off, Slow Mobius!"
99,Slow Mobius,"Ha ha! Sorry, dude! I'm just trying to show off my powers, bro!"
100,Morty,I can't believe she's here.
101,Rick,"Well, what are you doing standing here, Morty? Go. Talk to her. (He shoves Morty away. Morty follows Jessica.)"
102,Rick,"Tonight, the only adventure you're on is your cusping manhood."
103,Jerry,"Oh, Rose."
104,Lucy,Whee!
105,Jerry,Is that what I think it is?
106,Lucy,"(Off screen) Yes, every couple gets to re-create Jack's drowning at the end of the movie."
107,Lucy,It's so romantic.
108,Jerry,I can't wait to do that with Beth.
109,Lucy,"I don't know, Jerry. With all due respect, it seems like your wife may not be that interested."
110,Jerry,"(Gasp!) Look! (Points at the iceberg in front of the boat, as it rises higher out of the water)"
111,Voice through speaker,"Iceberg, right ahead! The buffet is now closed. "
112,Voice through speaker,"Iceberg, right ahead! The buffet is now closed."
113,Captain #1,"(Worried) Uh, sir? There's not a problem."
114,Captain #2,What do you mean there's not a problem?
115,Captain #1,The guidance system isn't putting us on a direct collision course. This ship is about to completely miss the giant iceberg!
116,Captain #2,"Well, do something! Steer into it!"
117,Captain #1,(Frantically trying to steer towards the iceberg) I'm trying!
118,Captain #2,"It's too late. (Removes his hat, and speaks into a microphone.) Ladies and gentlemen... Don't brace yourselves."
119,Jerry,No! What happened?!
120,Lucy,Their rail system must have failed.
121,Passengers,"Oh, my God! We're not gonna sink! What are we gonna do?!"
122,Guy,Totally gonna get laid tonight. (Drinks from the cup.)
123,Tammy,(In awe) I like your feathers.
124,Birdperson,They are designed to attract the attention of the female.
125,Tammy,It's working.
126,Birdperson,"Tammy, I should let you know I just got out of a highly intense soul bond with my previous spirit mate."
127,Tammy,I'm not looking to get into a soul bond. I'm just looking for... (Whispers into Birdperson's ear.)
128,Birdperson,I believe birdperson can arrange that.
129,Nancy,"Hey, Summer, haven't seen you at flute practice in a while."
130,Girl,"Summer, don't tell me you're friends with her."
131,Summer,(Lying) Are you kidding me? I don't even know what she's doing here.
132,Rick,"Whoa. Not cool, summer. This is a party. (He accidentally splashes some of his drink into Nancy's face.) Everybody should be welcome."
133,Rick,"Oh, great. Who invited Abradolph Lincoler? (Tries to hide his face from Abradolph Lincoler.)"
134,Summer,I thought everyone was welcome.
135,Rick,"It's not the same, Summer. Lincoler is a crazed maniac -- just a misguided effort of mine to create a morally neutral superleader by combining the DNA of Adolf Hitler and Abraham Lincoln. Turns out (burp)  it just adds up to a lame, weird loser."
136,Abradolph Lincoler,"Rick, you brought me into this world, a suffering abomination tortured by the duality of its being."
137,Abradolph Lincoler,(Walks closer to Rick) But I shall finally know peace when I watch the life drain from your wretched body! (He accidentally bumps Brad with his arm. Brad is standing next to Jessica and Morty)
138,Brad,"Whoa. What's up, man?"
139,Abradolph Lincoler,"I have no quarrel with you, boy."
140,Brad,"""Boy""? What's that supposed to mean? (Gets up into Abradolph Lincoler's face)"
141,Abradolph Lincoler,"(Threatened) It's just -- l-look, I-I don't know how you thought I meant it, but... (Looks at Rick for help)"
142,Rick,"Don't look at me, dude."
143,Abradolph Lincoler,"Look, I'm half-Abraham Lincoln, so --"
144,Brad,(Angry) So I should get on my knees and kiss your ass?!
145,Abradolph Lincoler,"Well, no, but... You know?"
146,Brad,What do I know? That the third reich will reign for a thousand years?
147,Jessica,"Leave him alone, Brad."
148,Brad,"Stay out of this, Jessica!"
149,Rick,"Kick his ass, Brad! (chanting) "
150,Everyone except Morty and Jessica,(Chanting) Kick his ass! Kick his ass! Kick his ass!
151,Jessica,Brad! 
152,Morty,Rick!
153,Rick,"(Shoves Morty towards the door where jessica went) I just did you a favor, Morty."
154,Morty,Sorry about all that. Rick has some really strange friends.
155,Jessica,(Annoyed) Ugh! Brad is such a jerk. He's always trying to prove what a man he is. I just want to find somebody nice and sweet.
156,Morty,"Jessica, can I show you something?"
157,Jessica,Wow! Look at all this stuff.
158,Morty,(Walks over to the shelves and picks up a circular device.) Yeah. This is me and my grandpa Rick's Sci-Fi workshop. Check this out.
159,Jessica,It's beautiful.
160,Morty,"You know, Jessica, there's something I've always wanted to tell you."
161,Jesica,"What's that, Morty?"
162,Morty,I think that you're the most --
163,Jessica,"No, that -- those weird sounds coming from the closet over there. (Points at the shaking closet.)"
164,Jessica,Aah! 
165,Morty,"Oh, my God!"
166,Squanchy,"Hey, I'm squanching in here!"
167,Morty,"Oh, my God! Oh, that is so disgusting!"
168,Morty,"Ow! Oh! Oh, crap!"
169,Rick,"Huh. Big star in the sky. (Breathes in) Oxygen-rich atmosphere. Giant testicle monsters. (Turns around, excited) We'll be fine! Let's party!"
170,Stereo,"♪ Just shake that ass, bitch, and let me see whatcha got ♪"
171,Summer,"I swear to God, Morty, if it weren't for the fact that everyone's still having a blast in there, I would be so furious with you right now."
172,Rick,"Oh, man. Y-you hear that, Morty? You really lucked out with Summer o-on that one. (Sips from his drink)"
173,Morty,"How are you guys not freaking out right now?! T-the whole house is sitting in another dimension! I-I mean, w-what the hell are we supposed to do?! M-m-mom and dad are gonna kill us! I'm losing it here, Rick!"
174,Rick,"(Holds Morty to get his attention) Relax, Morty, rela-a-a-ax! (Lets go) It's gonna be fine. All we have to do is go out and find us some kalaxian crystals. (Rick is still scanning with his device. It suddenly starts to beep.) Oh, shit, motherfucker! Kalaxian crystals, Morty, just a few miles South of here."
175,Morty,"Okay. Let's go, then."
176,Morty,"W-w-we got to go get those crystals right now, Rick."
177,Rick,"(Makes Morty let go) Whoa, whoa, whoa. Morty, Morty, I-I can't go with you. I got to hang back and make sure everything stays cool here, you know? I mean, who knows what -- what if somebody breaks something?"
178,Summer,Yeah. Me too. I should stay.
179,Abradolph Lincoler,You guys have any aspirin?
180,Rick,"Oh, hey, Morty, this is perfect! You can take Lincoler with you."
181,Abradolph Lincoler,"Hey, man, I'm not going anywhere. I'm injured."
182,Rick,"Shut up, Lincoler. (Shoves him away) It's the least you can do for wrecking the living room."
183,Summer,"(Grabs Nancy's shoulders) Yeah! And, Nancy, you should go, too."
184,Nancy,What? Why -- why me?
185,Summer,"Because, uh, you're -- you're so good at playing the flute. (Shoves Nancy towards Morty and Abradolph Lincoler)"
186,Captain #2,"Sorry for the inconvenience, folks. We should resume sinking shortly. In the meantime, please, stay on the ship and enjoy a complimentary plate of James Cameronion rings. (He hands Beth a small card.)"
187,Jerry,"(Annoyed) Great. Not only is the ship not sinking, but now the fourth wall has been broken."
188,Beth,(Sigh) I am gonna go back to the room to finish my book. You should find that Lucy woman. (Walks away from Jerry)
189,Jerry,But -- but --
190,Lucy,"You see, Jerry? (She puts her hand on Jerry's shoulder) May I show you something?"
191,Lucy,"Had everything gone as planned, this entire area would be underwater."
192,Jerry,"I would have liked to see it. This trip has been a ""Titanic"" failure. (Turns to face Lucy) Get it?"
193,Jerry,(Shocked and confused) Ooh!
194,Lucy,"Draw me, Jerry."
195,Jerry,"(Awkwardly glancing at her body) Oh, boy. Lucy, wow. Uh, this isn't what I had in mind."
196,Lucy,But it's the perfect moment. We've been dreaming about this for 16 years.
197,Jerry,"Um, not like this. Not -- not with you. Heh."
198,Lucy,"(Lifts up a gun she has in her hand, and aims it at Jerry. She walks towards him) You are gonna draw me."
199,Jerry,Aah! (Backs away)
200,Lucy,Then you're going to fuck me in that car over there. (Points at an old-fashion car with the gun)
201,Abradolph Lincoler,"(Thinking) It's weird, 'cause I definitely think that all men are created equal. But, at the same time --"
202,Morty,"(Interupts him to shut him up) Okay! Um, the crystals should be really close."
203,Nancy,(Points at big pink crystals growing out of the ground) There they are!
204,Abradolph Lincoler,Wait. Something's not right.
205,Abradolph Lincoler,"Get the crystals! I'll handle the beast! Prepare to be emancipated from your own inferior genes! (He lunges at the creature, as he tackles it down. Nancy and Morty quickly grab some crystals and put them in a small bag.)"
206,Nancy,Summer's gonna like me again. 
207,Morty,"Lincoler, come on! Let's get out of here!"
208,Abradolph Lincoler,"Mein journey is over, Morty. (Grunts) I have something important to tell you."
209,Gearhead,"♪ And the gears, they turned for a thousand years ♪ ♪ until the dark day that they stopped ♪"
210,Morty,"(Huff) Rick, I got them! I got the crystals! (He hands Rick the bag)"
211,Rick,"All right! You did it, Morty. (Walks away)"
212,Morty,"Rick, wait! There's something you need to know. I couldn't have done it without Lincoler. He said that he was really sorry and that he loves you like a father."
213,Morty,"He only wanted you to accept him, and he hopes that his final act would redeem him in your eyes. (Morty tears up and wipes his eye) He sacrificed himself to save all of us, Rick. He died."
214,Rick,"Well, at least he didn't die in vain. He got these crystals. (Rick cuts up the crystals into dust with his credit card, and snorts it up. Ricks eyes turn blue) And these babies just saved this lame-ass party! Wubba, lubba, dub, dub! Play something. Somebody, play something."
215,Morty,Wait a minute. What?
216,Rick,(Dancing)  ♪ Put your right foot forward ♪ ♪ and your left foot back ♪ ♪ then fucking slide around ♪
217,Rick,♪ move to the left ♪
218,Song,"♪ it's the, it's the ♪"
219,Rick,"Slow Mobius, hit me with the clock beam!"
220,Song,"♪ It's the, it's the ♪ ♪ it's the Rick dance ♪"
221,Rick,"That's the Rick dance! All right! (burp) Whoa, man!"
222,Morty,What the hell was that?! I thought those crystals were supposed to help us get home or something!
223,Rick,"What? No, no, no. I can get us home whenever I want to. But, listen, speaking of those crystals, can I get the rest of them? I'm starting to come down, Morty. (His eye color turns back to normal) Crystal kalaxian is a really strong, but fleeting high. (He scratches the side of his face)"
224,Morty,"That's what I think of your crystals, Rick!"
225,Rick,"Oh, Morty, you idiot! Does anybody else have any more k-lax? B-birdperson?"
226,Rick,"Uh, squanchy?"
227,Squanchy,Don't squaunch at me.
228,Morty,"All right, everybody, party is officially over! Rick, take us home now."
229,Rick,"All right, all right, fine, Morty, you party pooper buzzkill! Boo, boo! Morty sucks!"
230,Tammy,"Boo! You suck, whatever your name is."
231,Everyone,Boo!
232,Rick,"Morty, you're the worst, Morty."
233,Gearhead,But these gears just started turnin'.
234,Lucy,"Almost finished, Jerry?"
235,Jerry,"Uh, almost. I haven't quite captured your beautiful eyes."
236,Lucy,(Still holding the gun) I'm sure it's good enough. Move!
237,Lucy,"Every weekend, Jacks and Roses have their Titanic experience in this car, and I have to mop it up. The floor drops out to make it easier. (She licks the car, as the floor of the car detatches.) But now it's my turn. We're going to get it nice and steamy in there, and I'm going to slam my hand on the steam and leave a nice handprint, and then you're going to love inside of me."
238,Lucy,No mess. No clean.
239,Jerry,(Reieved) Beth!
240,Beth,Bet you're glad I think kindles are dumb now.
241,Beth,I can't help but feel a little guilty. I didn't peg Lucy for a rapist.
242,Jerry,"What does a rapist look like exactly, Beth? Is it a slavic man wearing a denim jacket with a patchy beard and the scent of cheap champagne wafting over his blister-pocked lips? (Feeling scared due to a flashback)"
243,Beth,What?
244,Beth,"Well, at least you got all this free stuff. (She enters the door into the drivers seat, as Jerry closes the back door, and tries to fit a painting board from the titanic boat.)"
245,Beth,Should be enough to satisfy your Titanic Jones for a while.
246,Jerry,"(Puts the board into the passenger seat) Ugh! I'm not going to fit. (Hangs onto the board, recreating Jack's death from the Titanic movie. He slowly slips off) Beth, listen to me. You're going to get out of here. You're gonna go on, and --"
247,Beth,"(Interrupts Jerry) Jerry, just leave the door."
248,Jerry,"It's not a door, Beth. It's debris."
249,Beth,I don't care. Just leave it.
250,Jerry,"Yeah. Okay. (He takes out the board and leaves it on the ground, as he gets into the car. He has Lucy's necklace. He drops it out of the car window. Lucy is seen hanging onto the underneath of their car. The car starts moving)"
251,Lucy,"Ahahahah! ""Cape fear""! Hahahaha! ""Cape fear""! I'm -- I'm doing -- I'm -- I'm going to do like from ""cape fear""."
252,Lucy,Ugh! Auh! Augh! (huff) (huff) 
253,Squanchy,"Hey, squanchers! The party's squanching on at my place!"
254,Summer,"Cool. I'm coming, too."
255,Squanchy,"(Stops Summer) Uh, no. You're not squanchy enough for a squanchy party."
256,Summer,What?
257,Squanchy,Nancy told us what a bitch you are. (Leaves)
258,Summer,"Guys, seriously. Nancy?"
259,Nancy,"Summer, you're a bad person. All you care about is having popular people like you. That's not what Abradolph Lincoler stood for. Well, I-it was hard to pin down what he stood for, but it's certainly not what he died for."
260,Summer,"Next time I party, I'm just gonna focus on getting totally wrecked. (To Rick) You're so wise."
261,Rick,"(Groan) (Mumbles) Hmm, yeah. Mhh mhm... (Rick falls asleep, snoring)"
262,Birdperson,May I assist you with that?
263,Morty,"Uh, sure, yeah. (Takes the trash and puts it in the garbage bag) Thanks. (Continues to pick up trash)"
264,Birdperson,"Morty, do you know what ""wubba lubba dub dub"" means?"
265,Morty,"Uh, that's just Rick's stupid nonsense catchphrase."
266,Birdperson,"(Walks up to Morty) It's not nonsense at all. In my people's tongue, it means, ""I am in great pain. Please help me."""
267,Morty,"Well, I got news for you. He's saying it ironically."
268,Birdperson,"No, Morty. Your grandfather is, indeed, in very deep pain. That is why he must numb himself."
269,Morty,"Come on, um..."
270,Birdperson,Birdperson.
271,Morty,"Come on, birdperson. Rick's not that complicated. He's just a huge asshole."
272,Birdperson,Then why do you care so much if you are no longer allowed to continue on your adventures together? It appears fate has presented you with an opportunity to free yourself of Rick forever.
273,Morty,You know what? You're right. I shouldn't even care. This is probably the best thing that could have happened to me.
274,Morty,I'm sick of having adventures with Rick.
275,Birdperson,"My people have another saying-- ""gubba nub nub doo rah kah"". It means, ""whatever lets you sleep at night""."
276,Summer,"Guys, mom and dad are, like, right around the corner."
277,Birdperson,"This is your moment, Morty. Choose wisely. Tammy!"
278,Birdperson,Caw!
279,Summer,Wow. We are so screwed.
280,Morty,"(Walks over to Rick, and shakes him) Rick, wake up."
281,Rick,Huh? What? Wait? What? What? Stop.
282,Morty,"Rick, you got to do something quick. My parents are home."
283,Rick,"Augh. Uh, all -- all right. (Sits up and grabs a glass of water sitting on the coffee table.) All right. Hold -- hold on. (He drinks from the glass) Ahh! So good. "
284,Morty,"Oh, my God. They're walking up the driveway."
