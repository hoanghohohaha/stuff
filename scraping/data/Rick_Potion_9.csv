1,Principal Vagina,"(over the intercom, while the students talk) Principal Vagina here, don't let the name fool you, I'm very much in charge, reminding you that tonight is our annual flu season dance. I don't know how many times I have to say this but if you have the flu, stay home, the flu season dance is about awareness, not celebration. You don't bring dead babies to Passover."
2,Jessica's friend,(to Jessica) Hey.
3,Morty,"Ohhh. Okay, here we go. * walks over to Jessica and her friends* (Nervously) H-Heyy Jessica, ughh."
4,Jessica,What's up Morty? *sneezes*
5,Morty,Ugghh
6,Brad,*butts in* What are you doing?
7,Morty,Ummm
8,Brad,"Wait, wait, Were you about to talk... to her?"
9,Morty,"Well, I mean, I was thinking about it."
10,Brad,"Dude, Stay in your league! Look at how hot she is! You don't see me going to a bigger school, in a wealthier district and hittin' on their prettiest girl!"
11,Jessica,"(sarcastically) Gee, thanks, Brad."
12,Brad,"I throw balls far. You want good words, date a languager."
13,Jerry,"Eh, Try not to worry about it, Morty. You're a good kid, and there's not a premium on that right now, but you'll be getting girls sometime after Brad's out of shape."
14,Morty,"(Plays with a cookie in sadness) You're missing the point, Dad. I don't want girls, I want Jessica!"
15,Jerry,"Ahhh, well, (gets another jar of sauce out of the cupboard) I remember feeling that way about a young lady named your mom, and that's not an urban dis, your mom was my Jessica. I remember the first time I saw her, I thought..."
16,Rick,"(enters and interrupts Jerry) I should get her pregnant, then she'll have to marry me. (grabs a glass from a cupboard)"
17,Jerry,"I beg your pardon, Rick, INAPPROPRIATE. (points to Morty)"
18,Rick,"(grabs ice from out of the freezer)(sarcastically) Sorry, please proceed with your story about banging my daughter in high school. (gets juice out of the refrigerator) I'm not sure you want to take romantic advice from this guy, Morty, his marriage is hanging from a thread."
19,Jerry,"(Angrily) My marriage is fine, thank you."
20,Rick,"Jerry, it's your house, whatever you say it is is how it is, (pours juice into the glass) but I think a blind man could see that Beth is looking for the door. I barely have a reason to care and even I noticed."
21,Morty,"Come on, Rick, don't talk about my parents like that."
22,Rick,"Listen, Morty, I hate to break it to you, but what people call ""love"" is a chemical reaction that compels animals to breed. It hits hard, Morty, then it slowly fades, leaving you stranded in a failing marriage. I did it, your parents are gonna do it. Break the cycle, Morty. Rise above. Focus on science. (exits room, drinking juice)"
23,Morty,"(In woe) Alright, well, I'm gonna go get dressed for the dance. (exits kitchen)"
24,Jerry,"Yeah, I'm just going to...check on your mom. (exits opposite direction)"
25,Rick,"(With his back to Morty) Morty, hand me that screwdriver, huh? *Morty closes door* I'm almost finished making my ionic defibulizer, Morty. It's gonna be great."
26,Morty,"Hey, listen, Rick. You know how you said that, you know... love is a chemical and all that stuff from earlier? (walks to Rick at his desk) Well, I was thinkn', you know, www... could you make some sort of chemical thing happen inside of Jessica's mind, you know, so where she falls in love with me and all that sort of thing, you know, like maybe make some sort of love potion or something?"
27,Rick,"Morty, that's such a poor use of my time, it's beneath me. Hand me the screwdriver. (points to the shelf)"
28,Morty,"(Angrily) YOU KNOW WHAT, NO RICK! I'M NOT GONNA HAND YOU THE SCREWDRIVER! Uh, I'm never gonna hand you anything ever again, Rick. (Rick gets up and grabs a box of supplies from the shelf) I'm always helping you with this and that and the other thing. Www...what about me, Rick? Www... why can't you just help me out once, once, for once?"
29,Rick,"*sighs* You're growing up fast, Morty. You're growing into a real big thorn straight up into my ass! (grabs some test tubes with yellow liquid and holds one up) Listen, this is called oxytocin. I extracted it from a vole. You know what a VOLE is, Morty, you know what a vole is?"
30,Rick,"It's a, it's a rodent that mates for life, Morty. This is the chemical release in the mammal's brain, (sets down the box of objects, opens a hatch in a machine, and pours the oxytocin in) ...that makes it fall in love. Alright Morty, I just gotta *burps* combine it with some of your DNA."
31,Morty,"Oh well, okay... (zips down his fly)"
32,Rick,"A hair, Morty, I need one of your hairs! This isn't Game Of Thrones. (plucks hair from Morty's head)"
33,Morty,Oww!
34,Rick,"(grabs the flask containing the orange liquid) Alright, Morty, whoever you smear this stuff on will fall in love with you, and only you, forever. Ya happy now, Morty?"
35,Morty,"Heck yeah! Thank you, Grandpa Rick! (walks to the door, but thinks about it and looks back) Hey there's no dangers or anything or side effects, right?"
36,Rick,"Www.. what am I, a hack?! Go nuts, Morty, it's full proof."
37,Rick,"Ugh, unless she has the flu. (shrugs it off)"
38,Jerry,"Beth, do you still love me?"
39,Beth,*sighs* Want kinda question is that?
40,Jerry,"The ""yes"" or ""no"" kind. *weak laugh of obviousness*"
41,Beth,"Jerry, do you want homeless people to have homes?"
42,Jerry,Yess.
43,Beth,Are you gonna build them?
44,Jerry,Noo.
45,Beth,"Then what good was the ""yes""?"
46,Jerry,"(walks to Beth at the computer)(confused) Wait, iii... is loving me the house or the homeless people?"
47,Beth,"(Turns around to Jerry)(Irritated) Loving you is work, Jerry, hard work, like building a homeless shelter. Nobody want to say ""no"" to doing it, but some people put the work in. So what do ya say? Do you see me working here? Does this conversation seem tedious to me?"
48,Jerry,Sort of.
49,Beth,"But I obviously sort of love you, don't I? *alert on Beth's phone* So stop asking and maybe I'll love you more. (looks at her phone) Crap, They need me at the horse hospital."
50,Jerry,This late?
51,Beth,"(puts on her jacket) The racetrack had a starlit derby, there's a seven horse collision, and Davin's there alone. (leaves the room, leaving Jerry alone)"
52,Jerry,"(In his head)(Progressively angrier) *Davin, Davin, Davin, Davin, Davin, Davin, Davin, Davin*"
53,Band Vocalist / MC Haps,"(Background) Flu. Yo, you gotta be aware. Aware about the flu, up in the air. Imma get me a shot and make the flu go away. Flu hatin' rappers just rappin' away. Yo. Yo. Flu hatin' rapper. It's a flu hatin' rap....This is about flu awareness. Gotta be aware of the flu in the airness. Yo, I'm a flu hatin' rapper. My name is MC Haaaaaaaaaaps- Haps Yeah, I'm MC Haps, I'm a flu hatin' rapper, yo......"
54,Morty,"Hey there, Jessica. (Pretends to trip, wiping the potion on Jessica's arm) Whooa-whoopsie!"
55,Morty,"WOW, thanks!"
56,Morty,"Oh man. I love you too, Jessica! (Brad walks passed with a drink, he overhears)"
57,Brad,"(outraged) *spits* Is this punk bothering you, Jessica?(shoves Morty)"
58,Jessica,"(Infected) LEAVE HIM ALONE, JERK! (pulls Morty away) I'M IN LOVE WITH HIM! HE'S MORE MAN THEN YOU WILL EVER BE! *sneezes*"
59,Brad,"(infected) Aw man, Morty, ugh, I'm really sorry."
60,Morty,"Oh, well, no problem Brad."
61,Brad,"(hugs Morty)(infected) There's somethin' special bout you, somethin' special. (squeezes Morty's butt and back)"
62,Morty,"(pushes Brad away) Whoa, take it easy!"
63,Jessica,(grabs Morty's left arm)(infected) GET YOUR HANDS OFF OF HIM!
64,Brad,(grabs Morty's right arm)(infected) BACK OFF I'M TRYING TO BE WITH MY MAN!
65,Principal Vagina,"(Stops the fight, pulling Brad back, aided with Mr. Goldenfold) That's enough Bradley. We don't want you injuring your ball-throwing arm."
66,Brad,"(disappointment)(infected) Oh, Principal Vagina."
67,Jessica,"(infected) Never leave me, Morty, NEVER."
68,Morty,"(confused) Uh, sure. I mean, of course not. What do you think that was all about?"
69,Jessica,(infected) Who cares? Just hold me.
70,Brad,"(infected) LET ME GO!!! I LOVE YOU MORTY! *sneeze, sneeze* (exits the gym)"
71,Jerry,(V.O.) She's gonna be alone with that guy all night.
72,Summer,"Yeah, Dad, digging around the inside of horses. It's not a very romantic setting."
73,Rick,"Well, Summer, there's always the possibility that she made the whole work thing up."
74,Summer,"Grandpa, so gross!"
75,Rick,"Well, she's my daughter, Summer."
76,Jerry,She's not responding to my texts!
77,Summer,"Careful, dad."
78,Jerry,"Well, isn't that convenient?"
79,Rick,"Not for the men they cheat on, no."
80,Jerry,"Okay, I'm... going to go out... for some ice cream."
81,Summer,"God, grandpa, you're such a dick."
82,Rick,"I'm sorry, Summer."
83,Summer,Screw that.
84,Rick,It is?
85,Summer,Yeah.
86,Rick,Uh-oh.
87,Morty,Please just let this work out.
88,Morty,Um... can we maybe go somewhere more private?
89,Morty,"Oh, crap."
90,Rick,"Morty, come on!"
91,Morty,[wails] are you okay?
92,Morty,I'm fine!
93,Rick,"I didn't realize when I gave you that serum that Jessica had the flu you know, t-t-t-t-t-t-t-that might have been valuable information for me, Morty."
94,Morty,"What the hell is going on, Rick?"
95,Rick,What does it look like?
96,Morty,"Oh, crap."
97,Rick,"It's gonna be fine, Morty, relax."
98,Rick,"Okay, well, sometimes, science is more art than science, Morty."
99,Jerry,[gasps]
100,Jerry,Nobody's killing me until after I catch my wife with another man.
101,Summer,[groans] Come on.
102,Summer,What the hell?
103,Summer,[screams]
104,Morty,"Oh, my god, Rick."
105,Rick,"Yeah, it's pretty wild how fast that spread."
106,Morty,Outdone yourself?!
107,Rick,"Yeah, I don't know what I was thinking."
108,Morty,"I don't that doesn't make any sense, Rick."
109,Morty,"What, Morty, you want me to show you my math?"
110,Beth,"Yes, it's satisfying work."
111,Beth,"Hmm, uh, what are you doing?"
112,Beth,"Oh, ha, um, hey, I b I'd better get going."
113,Beth,"What is it, davin?"
114,Beth,What?!
115,Beth,"Let go of me, davin!"
116,Jerry,[grunts] You're not Morty.
117,Jerry,No.
118,Jerry,"[grunting] Yeah? Well, look where being smart got you."
119,Beth,Jerry! Thank god!
120,Jerry,God?
121,Beth,"Thank you, Jerry."
122,Rick,"Take a good look down there, Morty, and soak it in, because, you know, once I pull this lever, it's all back to normal."
123,Morty,Just do it already.
124,Rick,"Well, technically, Morty, there's no rush."
125,Morty,"That's it, Rick!"
126,Rick,"W-what do we have here, Morty?"
127,Morty,"Oh, Rick, something's not right."
128,Rick,"[sighs] Yeah, you."
129,Morty,"No, no!"
130,Rick,"Bet you're loving this, Morty."
131,Jerry,Hold on.
132,Beth,[whimpers]
133,Jerry,I wish that shotgun was my pen1s.
134,Beth,"If it were, you could call me ernest hemingway."
135,Jerry,"I don't get it, and I don't need to."
136,Summer,Mom! Dad!
137,Both,Summer!
138,Beth,[sighs]
139,Jerry,Where's Morty?
140,Summer,I don't know.
141,Jerry,"It's not fair to assume that, Summer."
142,Beth,"Oh, not fair?"
143,Summer,Tchoo.
144,Rick,"Boy, Morty, I really cronenberged the world up, didn't i?"
145,Morty,"Oh, my god!"
146,Rick,Me irresponsible?!
147,Morty,"All right, fine."
148,Morty,"All right, all right, Morty."
149,Morty,"Wow, Rick, I got to say you really pulled a rabbit out of your hat this time."
150,Rick,"Come on, Morty."
151,Morty,"Sure thing, Rick."
152,Rick,"All right, Morty."
153,Morty,"Oh, my god, Rick!"
154,Rick,"Calm down, Morty!"
155,Morty,"No, I can't deal with this!"
156,Rick,"Calm yourself, Morty."
157,Morty,"I can't deal with this, Rick!"
158,Rick,"Calm down, Morty."
159,Morty,This can't be real!
160,Rick,"You got to calm down, Morty."
161,Morty,W-w-w-w-we're ripped apart!
162,Rick,Shut up and listen to me!
163,Morty,This is insane.
164,Rick,"Look, Morty, I'll grab myself, you grab yourself, okay?"
165,Morty,"Rick, what about the reality we left behind?"
166,Rick,"What about the reality where hitler cured cancer, Morty?"
167,Summer,"You know, the thing about a shark... he's got lifeless eyes... black eyes, like a doll's eyes."
168,Jerry,[sighs] You ever wonder what happened to Rick and Morty?
169,Beth,Sometimes.
170,Rick,"Here we are, cronenberg Morty a reality where everyone in the world got genetically cronenberged."
171,Morty,"Yeah, cronenberg Rick, but, you know, I'm gonna miss cronenberg world, because everyone was cronenberged all along like us from the beginning, you know?"
172,Rick,"Don't you worry about that sort of thing, cronenberg Morty."
